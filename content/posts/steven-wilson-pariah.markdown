I don't remember when exactly I heard Porcupine Tree for the first time. It was probably in 2003 and they soon became my all-time favourite band. Porcupine Tree are still holding the number one position on my [Last.fm chart](https://www.last.fm/user/Aaaron/library/artists?date_preset=ALL). The band is currently on hiatus, but the frontman Steven Wilson keeps making wonderful music.

Sometimes it's good to leave the past behind and focus on something different. It might be a starting point for something great.
