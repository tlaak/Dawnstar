After dreaming of a vinyl player for years, I finally decided to get one.

I bought a [Rega Planar 2 turntable](http://www.rega.co.uk/planar-2-2016.html),
which is connected via [Rega Fono Mini A2D pre-amp](http://www.rega.co.uk/fono-mini-a2d.html)
to the line-in connector of a [Sonos Play 5](https://www.sonos.com/en-gb/shop/play5.html) speaker.

The setup is not perfect though as the pre-amp doesn't have a volume output
control at all. ~~The only way to adjust the volume is to access the room settings
in the Sonos app and change line-in level from there. The built-in volume control
in Sonos is disabled for line-in signal. Maybe I'll get a better pre-amp some day.~~

**Update 17/11/2018:** This is not actually true. The volume control works as you
would expect it to work. I'm not sure if this was due to an update in the Sonos
software or some error in my configuration.

The shelf is made by [KomodaFurniture](https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/630836743/industrial-tv-stand-vinyl-storage-unit).

I really like how my setup looks like. The sound of a record feels very different after
getting used to digital streaming services, but it's very much subjective anyway. Some
people think that the sound of a vinyl record is close to perfection,
while digital signal will always be inferior. I don't have strong opinion about it, but
I sometimes like to do things in an old fashioned way. Browsing through the records
in your shelf feels very different to browsing through Spotify playlists.

A spinning record looks insanely cool! Can you achieve that with any streaming service?
