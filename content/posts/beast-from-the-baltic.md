The past couple of weeks have been really cold. They media calls it the _Beast From The Baltic_, a bit like the _Beast From The East_, which brought proper ice and snow in London three years ago when I moved here from Berlin. There hasn't been much snow, to be fair, but the temperature has dropped below 0ÂºC and even stayed there for several days. It should be getting warmer soon though. I can feel the spring is just behind the corner!

There hasn't really been much going on. Just an endless groundhog day all over again. I just wanted to give some kind of an update to tell that I'm still here.
