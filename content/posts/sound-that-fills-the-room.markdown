There is music that sounds just awesome, regardless of the way you listen to it. Be it from a vinyl record, digital high resolution lossless file or good old C-cassette, we often give highest value to the song itself and the lyrics, not the media.

For audiophiles the technology seems to be more important than the music itself. It's possible to spend insane amounts of money for audio equipment.

I value both high quality audio technology and great music. I'm not ready to spend thousands of euros in speakers and amplifiers though.

Sometimes you don't have to. I've been very much satisfied in the sound quality of my two Sonos Play:1 speakers. They sound great, although the software is not really on the same level.

Sometimes you find a new song that fills the whole room and takes you on a musical trip.
