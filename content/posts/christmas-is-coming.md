It's less than a couple of weeks until Christmas. After a week, the days will start getting longer again. This year has been insanely long and difficult for all of us. I believe 2021 will be much better.

I started in a new job in October and that has kept me busy during the weekdays. I upgraded my home office setup to contain another 5K display, which probably is a bit of an overkill to have. MacOS is not really so great with a multi-display setup but at least I can have my code editor, terminal window and browser visible all the time.

I also ordered a HÃ…G Capisco chair but I still haven't received it. It's been about 6 weeks now since ordering it and hopefully it arrives before Christmas. My back cannot survive sitting on an IKEA stool and I can't stand all the time either. With 2 displays, the desktop riser I have is at its highest recommended capacity and it is quite heavy to lift up. I'm slightly concerned that it won't hold the weight and will collapse, damaging the displays.

In the other news, everyone is pretty much waiting for a _No Deal_ and hard Brexit to become into reality. I was able to reduce the anxiety regarding US presidential elections just by not reading the news or social media. Unfortunately I cannot really escape a No Deal as I happen to live in London.

We have a good amount of European products such as Italian tin tomatoes and pasta stocked in our cupboards, but if there will be any shortages, the disruption in availability will probably last for months. We are fine if the prices jump, but there's already so much poverty in this country that a No Deal Brexit cannot bring anything good to the people.

Meanwhile, brace yourselves and hope for the best.
