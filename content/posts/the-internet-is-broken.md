The internet! The internet is broken! Our broadband provider
[Relish](https://www1.relish.net) has usually worked just fine without any major
long-lasting hiccups. Sometimes the speed hasn't really met our expectations,
but it's a wireless 4G broadband. It's not fibre!

Last Sunday, everything suddenly changed.

Constant hiccups! The connection dies, doesn't work at all until the router gets rebooted.
Speed drops below 56k modem level and frustration grows beyond the limit where it's
trying to make us crazy, constantly pushing the anger-o-meter to the
reddest of the red hue of the spectrum.

Today we decided to do something about it by ourselves, as customer service
wasn't really able to detect any issues with our router. _"It must be interference"_, they said.
Yes, they are probably right, but it doesn't help us as we cannot track the origin
of that inteference.

As I had not yet got rid of my old iPhone, we got a Vodafone Pay-As-You-Go SIM
card and our internet now pretty much is provided by that loyal old companion of mine.

It's obviously not a perfect solution and I still need to figure out how to get
connection to my TV, game consoles and Sonos speakers.

We have roughly 2.5 months left in this flat so getting a DSL isn't really an option
right now. Originally we decided to go for wireless because the fastest available DSL
connections were estimated to be only 11MB, which is ridiculous in 2018.
