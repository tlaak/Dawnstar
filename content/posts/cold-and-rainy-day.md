It's been the coldest day since last spring. I've been wearing shorts for the
whole summer, but today I was freezing. It was also raining heavily in the noon.

After the hot and dry summer, some rain is very much welcome, but I really
like hot and dry weather more than cold and rainy.

The upcoming days should be a little bit warmer than today.
