Autumn 1999, a small town somewhere in Central Finland. I was tired and under the weather. My friend introduced me to Radiohead and played OK Computer. The others kept chatting in the kitchen and drinking beer, but I was laying down and focusing on the music. I think it was my first real connection to post rock and its daydreaming soundscapes.

I've loved every Radiohead album since OK Computer. In May 2016 I finally saw them playing live in Amsterdam. It was one of the best shows I've ever seen.
