Autumn is the time when the nature is preparing itself for the winter.

The leaves are getting colourful until they finally drop. Days are getting
shorter and colder. The end of summer often feels like the end of sunny days
and happy times.

For me autumn has always represented something different. It's a start of
something. It's often been the time when interesting things in life happen.
Things that will define how your future will look like.

Beginning of studies in a new school, starting in a new job, meeting new people
or falling in love and starting a long lasting relationship.

I'm curious to see what's waiting for me this year!
