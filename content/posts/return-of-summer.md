We thought that the autumn came early but here we are again, having temperatures of nearly 30ÂºC in the middle of September. I don't mind though. I've always been more of a summer person.

Quite a few things happened after my previous post. We're still in the middle of the pandemic. Lockdown is over but new restrictions have been set after the number of cases started rising again. I wouldn't be too surprised if we went back to the square one.

I don't really see the pandemic ending before a vaccine has been developed. I hope it happens soon as everyone's eager to get back to normal life with gigs, concerts, pub crawls and other social activities outside of the house.

In other news, I was made redundant in July and lost my job. Two weeeks later, I had an offer from a small consultancy in Germany. Unfortunately I had to decline it later due to logistical difficulties. There just wasn't an easy option for the two of us to move there when the other one has a job in London. We didn't want to live in different addresses either.

I'm still job hunting and interviewing actively. I'm quite confident that I can land a job soon.

Oh, speaking of us, we also got married! Yay!
