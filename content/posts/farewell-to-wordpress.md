Originally I set up this site to be able to just post links to different kinds
of music I like. I used [WordPress.com](https://wordpress.com) instead of
setting up my own local WordPress instance.

I haven't been posting much lately, but I hope that by lowering
the barrier for posting makes it easier. I don't want to log in anywhere
or use a complicated rich text editor. I'm a developer so I prefer writing
Markdown.

So I decided to spend a few evenings setting up a static site generator to
power up this site. Now everything runs with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) with an automated
deployment pipeline from [my GitHub](https://github.com/tlaak/Dawnstar) to [Netlify](https://netlify.com).

All I need to do is to open my terminal, create a new post, edit the content in
my favourite text editor, commit and push to GitHub.

The age of monolithic content management systems is coming to an end.
