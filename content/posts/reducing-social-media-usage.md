In November, when the US election day arrived, I noticed I was getting anxious. When the result still wasn't clear in the morning, I decided to take a break from all social media and news. As a result, I had two incredibly productive days at work and I felt so much better. The short break was enough to cure my anxiety but it tends to creep in every now and then, when I spend too much time on social media. By social media I mean mostly Facebook and Twitter.

That has lead me to think whether I should take another proper break, if not cut my ties with all social media for good. I'm still planning how to do it and how to spend the time I'll be getting back in the best possible way. I could read more books and I could read more articles. I could also write more blogs posts and my diary, which hasn't been updated in 5 months. I know a friend who's writing email newsletters to give updates about the events in her life. That sounds much better than writing those posts in social media, where your data is always used to target ads to you.

Long time ago when I was still chatting on IRC, I remember having a two month break in spring 2005. During that time I finished my master's thesis. I wonder what I could have achieved if I had learned to channel my energy towards useful activities and not waste my time in internet discussions and arguments. My brain clearly isn't capable of handling the constant flow of information.

I'll probably post an update here when I have made a decision.
