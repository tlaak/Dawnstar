My first pick for the albums of the decade is [**Until the Water Runs Clear**](https://open.spotify.com/album/18rzjP7mvpMHOqJjOGA1XR?si=3j_OhCbfQx2bqWipQVhhYQ) by **Black Casino and the Ghost**.

I found this band in early 2016 when they were warming up for Kula Shaker at Roundhouse. I had just agreed to accept an offer for a job in Berlin and was packing my belongings in London. I felt sad and didn't really want to leave, but it was such a great opportunity to be able to live in a new country that I had to take it.

This album kept my longing for London alive until I finally decided to move back. I don't think the band has really been active recently and as far as I know their amazing singer is living in Italy nowadays. I'd be happy to hear more of their music in the future!
