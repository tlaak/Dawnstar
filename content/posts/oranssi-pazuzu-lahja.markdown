In 2009 or 2010 I saw Oranssi Pazuzu for the first time at Nosturi in Helsinki, Finland. I didn't really know their music back then. To be honest, I wasn't too impressed. It was a quiet night. There were less than 50 people watching the show.

In April 2017 I saw them performing again, this time on the Main Stage of 013 arena at Roadburn Festival in Tilburg, Netherlands. There were probably around 2500 people watching. Quite a difference!

Everybody starts from scratch. We are not born as professionals or famous artists. We practice, we improve and we become better. Sometimes we lose our interest, sometimes we have the motivation and passion to continue until we become masters in what we do.

It might be a short walk or a lifetime journey.
