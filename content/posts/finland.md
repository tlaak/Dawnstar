I was born in Finland, but I moved abroad in the end of 2014. That was my long
time dream that had been bothering me since my early 20's. So far I haven't
really wanted to move back.

Today I'm flying to Finland for a holiday. It's a little bit special trip for me
as I haven't been there in over 15 months. That's the longest period I've been
away from my home country.

I am most likely going to experience a culture shock as that's how it's been
in the previous visits. The emptiness, the quietness, not much diversity,
doors that open to the wrong direction, insanely expensive restaurants and
the fact that you can't ignore what people are talking around you. It's a massive
cognitive overload.

On the other hand, I'm very much looking forward seeing my old friends
and catch up with them, but also to see the relatives, especially the ones
that weren't even born when I moved away.
