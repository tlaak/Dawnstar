After going to Slovenia for Metaldays festival, I decided to take a little
break and be without alcohol for few weeks. At the same time I also reduced
my carb intake below 100g in a day.

I've lost 4kg in 3.5 weeks and I've been much more productive than normally.
I've probably had more GitHub activity during these few weeks than during the
last few years altogether!

Despite not drinking alcohol, I've managed to participate in some social
activities. I've went to a board game evening, scored the third place in a pub
quiz with the team, and I even went to former workmate's farewell party.

So yes, it is possible to live a social life without drinking.
The problem is the other people who are drinking as they will become slightly
annoying when they get drunk. Who would have thought that?
