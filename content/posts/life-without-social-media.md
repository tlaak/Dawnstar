It's been a week since I deactivated my Facebook account. So far I haven't really missed it at all. I was expecting to get some sort of withdrawal symptoms but none have emerged so far.

I also logged out from Twitter and Instagram but I didn't deactivate the accounts. I haven't yet decided whether I want to keep them or not.

I still have my Reddit account as well and I've used it every now and then during this week. I've never been a super active Redditor though, so it's less about doomscrolling and more about finding inspirational posts where people present their creative work and achievements in life. Imgur works in the same way. I find it motivational rather than depressing so that's why I've kept these accounts active.

Have I noticed any difference, you may ask?

I feel that I'm disconnected from a constantly overflowing stream of information. My brain gets to rest and it's easier to focus on work and get into the flow. I've definitely slept much better and felt less tired.

I made myself a promise to read 50 books this year, which is quite a lot. So far I'm reading my fifth book so I believe I'm able to do it if I just pick books that are not 1000 pages long.

I believe using the time saved from social media browsing in reading and other personal development activities is time well spent.
