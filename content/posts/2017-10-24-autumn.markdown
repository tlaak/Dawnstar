One week ago it was still almost 25ÂºC warm. A real Indian Summer! As the days are getting shorter and shorter, the weather becomes more rainy and foggy. It will be mostly like this until March, when the spring will finally win. Winter in Berlin is dark and grey.

I had to buy a wake-up light to make waking up in the morning less of a struggle. It kinda works. At least I wake up before the birds start singing.
